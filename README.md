# goo.gl Chrome Extension
URL Shortener Chrome Extension

## What?
A one click Google URL Shortener for the current tab.

## Why?
I know there are many better URL shorteners but my first assignment at Symantec was to build any kind of Chrome Extension.

## How?
Nothing fancy. It consumes [Google URL Shortener API](https://developers.google.com/url-shortener/v1/getting_started). Just put your API key in `background.js`
